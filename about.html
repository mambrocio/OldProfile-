  <p>Hello, my name is Mike Ambrocio and I own this website. This website showcases aspects of me as a future web devloper. But for this page you will get to know me better other than reading the resum√© I provided in the home page. For starters I am enrolled in Valencia, and hoping to complete my A.S. In Web Development. 
  
  <br>
  <br>

  I chose this path becuase it allows me to have a creative and technical side complex as I tend to like hands on result when it comes to work.

  <br>
  <br>

  Within completing my A.S. degree I can hopefully get a career as a Junior Web Developer, more so in the front-end aspect. I try to expand my knowledge in the front-end aspect, and continue to do so. As of now this website is a culmination of all the knowledge I have been taught to and self taught, and so far this website is the culmination of my knowledge, and hopefully I can get to expand and evolve this site as the years go on.

  <br>
  <br>

  Hopefully as the years go by I can further expand my skills in Photoshop and UI/UX development. And maybe also work on Premiere Pro and Logic Pro as I enjoy video editing and audio editing.

<h2>Personal</h2>
  <div class="aboutpers">
    <p>So besides working on and expanding my digital portfolio this is how I spend time to myself. Though as I am writing this, this is from the perspective of the pandemic years in America. So as far as social events and outings go I am limited to my own devices.
    <br>
    <br>
       I really like to play on my guitar and in someways my coding and developing ethics have sort of reinforced my skills in learning the instrument by trying to pick up what can be done and reinforce one skill from another.
    <br>
    <br>
      Every year, I try to listen a new genre, artist, or album. As of this year I have been listening to Childish Gambino's aka Donald Glover's <em>Awaken My Love</em>, for its amazing soul, funk, and R&B fusion but managing to compose in a way that's his sound.
    <br>
    <br>
      When the pandemic hit the United States, I was hesitant to excercise outside since the pandemic is still raging on so I try to stay away from other people in my neighborhood street. I have been trying to get back into shape and try to get back into my old cardio health I once had.
    <br>
    <br>
      I like to play videogames and for some reason, the new genre I have been trying to get into is Resource Management/City Builidng simulators. FrostPunk is a great example as it puts yourself in a test of leadership, social awareness, and difficualt decesion making you have to make as a person leading a group of survivors in a frozen apocalypse.

<h2>Personality</h2>

  <img src="images/aboutPageImages/headspace.jpg" alt="A Man Looking At A Board Of Graphs And Images">
  <p>
    Here is what I am personally:
  <br>
    Creative - I try to find creative outlets for myself to express in.
  <br>
    Curious - Although things I may not be interested in at first, becomes in some ways fascinating for me to delve in later.
  <br>
    Team Player - Not neccessarily a leader but works along greatly and can give great advice when need be.
